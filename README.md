# Proseminar-SVM
Code used for my proseminar on the topic "Predicting the future", in which I dealt with Support Vector Machines.
As an application example for SVMs, I tested SVMs with different parameters (regularization parameter, kernel function, polynomial degree, ...) on the sklearn breastcancer dataset.
